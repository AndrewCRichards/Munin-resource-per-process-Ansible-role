{{ar_munin_memory_pp_plugin_name}}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Munin plugin to graph specified processes' %memory usage; uses the output of the
'ps' command. Note that 'ps' output should not be considered fully accurate, so this
plugin should be used to get an idea of trends of memory use; actual memory use will
be a bit different; please read Internet posts on this subject to understand why.

More info: http://free.acrconsulting.co.uk/other/munin-plugins.html#rpp

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This plugin is configured by adjusting the Ansible configuration that generates the
plugin script, so (at least currently) the settings for the script (basically the
list of processes to be graphed) are set in the Ansible inventory. There are two
special process names: 'kernel' sums the processes that show up as [process_name]
in the ps listing; this is primarily kernel threads and system processes. 'other'
is all 'ps' entries that aren't explicitly listed.
